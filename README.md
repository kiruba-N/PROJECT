PROJECT : TO PREDICT THE QUANTITY OF CHOCOLATE BAR BY USING LINEAR REGRESSION, DATA VISUALIZATION AND DASHBOARD.

Analyzing and enhancing the effectiveness, quality, and market alignment of the processes involved in the making of chocolate requires the analysis of production data. Analysis of production trends, operational efficiency, supply chain optimization, and market demand knowledge are the main goals of this study. With an emphasis on important data points including production dates, batch numbers, production volumes, raw material usage, production durations, and quality control metrics, data is gathered from a variety of sources, including internal production records, supply chain data, and sales figures.

Calculating summary statistics and displaying trends over time are two aspects of descriptive analysis. Diagnostic analysis looks at the underlying reasons for inefficiencies or quality problems and assists in finding correlations between variables. 

Prescriptive analysis creates optimization models and assesses various scenarios to increase production efficiency and lower costs, whereas predictive analysis uses previous data to forecast future production quantities and requirements. These analyses and the creation of interactive dashboards are to be carried out using tools such as Python, R, and data visualization.
Production effectiveness, yield rate, downtime, and inventory turnover are important measures to track. Dashboards and in-depth reports, such as quarterly supply chain assessments and monthly production overviews, are used to present these indicators. Stakeholders may assure effective supply chain management, increase product quality, and drive innovations in chocolate production by utilizing data-analytic methodologies to make well-informed decisions.
